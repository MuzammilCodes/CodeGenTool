# CodeGenTool

This is a .NET console application that automates the creation of boilerplate files for a microservices-based API structure. By entering an entity name, the tool generates fully structured C# files including:

API Controllers

Business layer interfaces and implementations

Repository layer interfaces and implementations

Corresponding Model class

It also updates the DependencyConfigurator.cs to inject the generated services automatically, streamlining the development process. Users can selectively include methods like GetAll, Create, Update, Enable, and more, making it customizable and efficient for rapid backend scaffolding in a clean architecture setup.
